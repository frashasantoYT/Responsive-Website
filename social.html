        <h2>Social Engineering </h2>
        <p>
            Social engineering is a deceptive and manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology and gain access to sensitive information, systems, or networks. Instead of relying on technical vulnerabilities, social engineering preys on human trust, curiosity, fear, or other emotions to trick individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that could compromise security. Common social engineering tactics include phishing emails, where attackers masquerade as trustworthy entities to trick recipients into clicking on malicious links or providing login credentials. Other methods include pretexting (creating a fabricated scenario to obtain information), baiting (offering something enticing to lure individuals), and quid pro quo (offering a service or benefit in exchange for information). The effectiveness of social engineering often relies on the targeted individual's lack of awareness, making education and awareness training essential in combating these manipulative tactics. Organizational policies and cybersecurity practices that emphasize verification of requests for sensitive information can also help mitigate the risks associated with social engineering attacks.</p>
