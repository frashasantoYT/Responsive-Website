        <h2>Phishing</h2>
        <p>Phishing, a cyber attack dating back to the mid-1990s, involves fraudulent emails, messages, or websites designed to deceive individuals into disclosing sensitive information like passwords or credit card details. Originating from the word "fishing," these attacks initially targeted online services like AOL, evolving from basic email scams to sophisticated tactics such as spear phishing in the 2000s. The 2010s witnessed the integration of various techniques, including mobile phishing ("smishing") and the emergence of "phishing as a service," reflecting organized cybercrime. In the 2020s, phishing remains a pervasive threat, adapting to technological trends and leveraging social engineering. To counter these attacks, individuals and organizations must stay vigilant, employ security measures like two-factor authentication, and invest in cybersecurity tools and education to mitigate risks associated with evolving phishing tactics.</p>
